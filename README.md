In Chapter 8 we start a Newspaper site and introduce the concept of custom user
models, a Django best practice that is rarely covered in tutorials. Simply put all new
projects should use a custom user model and in this chapter youâ€™ll learn how. Chapter
9 covers user authentication, Chapter 10 adds Bootstrap for styling, and Chapters 11-
12 implement password reset and change via email. In Chapters 13-15 we add articles
and comments to our project, along with proper permissions and authorizations. We
even learn some tricks for customizing the admin to display our growing data.
